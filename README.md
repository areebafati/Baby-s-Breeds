### üêæ Baby's Breed ‚Äî Dog Breed Identifier Web App

**Baby's Breed** is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrates with the open-source [TheDogAPI](https://thedogapi.com). It allows users to:

* Fetch random dog images along with their breed information
* Upload an image of a dog to identify its breed

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** TheDogAPI's breed detection feature relies on a limited dataset. If the uploaded image is not recognized or not present in the API‚Äôs database, it may return an random breed result. This limitation is due to the nature of the free API and is not a fault of the application itself.
